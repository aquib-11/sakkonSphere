                                    To put it simply, secure attachment is what most of us want.
                            
                                    Children who develop this attachment style had parents or primary caregivers who were more attentive to their needs. They felt safe, loved, and understood. Securely attached children sought comfort from the parent or caregiver when scared and preferred the comfort of this adult to strangers. 
                                    
                                    Research suggests that securely attached children are more empathetic as they get older.`,

If you have this attachment style, you may tend to be wary of getting close to others and worry whether a romantic partner loves you or not.
                            
                                    It's not easy for any of us when a relationship ends, but anxious attachment can make things especially difficult.
                            
                                    Children who are ambivalently attached are typically suspicious of strangers and distressed when separated from a caregiver. But unlike securely attached children, those with anxious or ambivalent attachment don’t seem to be comforted by the parent or caregiver’s return, and they may even refuse comfort.`

That last part may sound like a good way to protect ourselves from getting hurt (and it is!), but it's also a good way to prevent ourselves from finding meaningful, long-lasting relationships.
                            
                                    Children with an avoidant attachment may have had caregivers who weren’t emotionally available. They may have been left to take care of themselves because they couldn’t rely on a parent or guardian. These children might avoid parents and caregivers and not have a preference between a caregiver and a stranger.`,

Our attachment style is formed during early childhood by the way we interact with our parents or primary caregivers.
                            
                                    John Bowlby, a researcher credited as a creator of attachment theory, described attachment as "lasting psychological connectedness between human beings." He believed that forming attachment was also part of human survival, and these early childhood experiences shape development and behavior later in life.
                            
                                    Your bond with a primary caregiver forms the basis for your attachment with others. Children who can rely on their caregivers to be there consistently and meet their basic and emotional needs will likely see the same trend in other relationships and believe it’s safe to rely on others for comfort.
                            
                                    Psychologist Mary Ainsworth built on Bowlby’s work with her own study and concluded that there were three main attachment styles. Researchers then added a fourth style.`

While a number of factors contribute to the success or failure of our long-term relationships, our attachment style represents a possible underlying explanation for our relationship behaviors that we didn't previously understand.
                            
                                    This attachment style quiz is based on the four main attachment styles recognized by researchers and mental health providers. Each response corresponds to a different attachment style.
                            
                                    This quiz can be helpful if you want to learn more about attachment styles, what yours may be, and how attachment could impact your relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners. It can help you better understand your behaviors in relationships and determine if you could benefit from working with a mental health professional to discuss concerns about your attachment.`

                                    Old behaviors can be unlearned and replaced with new ones, and even a string of unsuccessful relationships doesn't mean you have an insecure attachment style.

Our attachment style is formed during early childhood by the way we interact with our parents or primary caregivers.
                            
                                    John Bowlby, a researcher credited as a creator of attachment theory, described attachment as "lasting psychological connectedness between human beings." He believed that forming attachment was also part of human survival, and these early childhood experiences shape development and behavior later in life.
                            
                                    Your bond with a primary caregiver forms the basis for your attachment with others. Children who can rely on their caregivers to be there consistently and meet their basic and emotional needs will likely see the same trend in other relationships and believe it’s safe to rely on others for comfort.
                            
                                    Psychologist Mary Ainsworth built on Bowlby’s work with her own study and concluded that there were three main attachment styles. Researchers then added a fourth style.`

While a number of factors contribute to the success or failure of our long-term relationships, our attachment style represents a possible underlying explanation for our relationship behaviors that we didn't previously understand.
                            
                                    This attachment style quiz is based on the four main attachment styles recognized by researchers and mental health providers. Each response corresponds to a different attachment style.
                            
                                    This quiz can be helpful if you want to learn more about attachment styles, what yours may be, and how attachment could impact your relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners. It can help you better understand your behaviors in relationships and determine if you could benefit from working with a mental health professional to discuss concerns about your attachment.`

                                    John Bowlby, a researcher credited as a creator of attachment theory, described attachment as "lasting psychological connectedness between human beings." He believed that forming attachment was also part of human survival, and these early childhood experiences shape development and behavior later in life.
                            
                                    Your bond with a primary caregiver forms the basis for your attachment with others. Children who can rely on their caregivers to be there consistently and meet their basic and emotional needs will likely see the same trend in other relationships and believe it’s safe to rely on others for comfort.
                            
                                    Psychologist Mary Ainsworth built on Bowlby’s work with her own study and concluded that there were three main attachment styles. Researchers then added a fourth style.`
